<h2>Sources and display modes</h2>
<p>
The MaMuT viewer is based on Tobias Pietzsch SPIM viewer, and therefore can handle multiple sources.
For example, in a multi-angle SPIM sequence, each angle is a source.
</p>
<p>
The viewer has two display modes, <i>single-source</i> and <i>fused</i>.
In <i>single-source</i> mode, only the <i>current</i> source is shown
(there is exactly one current source at any given time.)
In <i>fused</i> mode, all <i>active</i> sources are shown overlaid.
</p>
<p>
<i>Grouping</i> allows to group together several sources in single, virtual sources. 
This is particularly useful when dealing with multiple channels as individual sources. 

<table border="1">
<tr>
  <td class="a"><b>F</b></td>
  <td>Switch between <i>single-source</i> and <i>fused</i> mode.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td class="a"><b>1</b> / <b>2</b> / &hellip; / <b>0</b></td>
  <td>Make source 1/2/&hellip;/0 the current source.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td class="a"><b>Shift&nbsp;1</b> / <b>Shift&nbsp;2</b> / &hellip; / <b>Shift&nbsp;0</b></td>
  <td>Make source 1/2/&hellip;/0 active or inactive. (Toggle visibility in fused mode.)</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td class="a"><b>G</b></td>
  <td>Toggle grouping mode.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td class="a"><b>I</b></td>
  <td>Switch between tri-linear and nearest-neighbor interpolation.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td class="a"><b>S</b></td>
  <td>Show brightness settings.</td>

  <td class="a"><b>F6</b></td>
  <td>Show visibility and grouping settings.</td>

<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>
Using the mouse:
</p>
<table border="1">

  <td class="a"><b>Left-drag</b></td>
  <td>Rotate (pan and tilt) around the point where the mouse was clicked.</td>

  <td class="a"><b>Right-drag</b> or<br/><b>Middle-drag</b></td>
  <td>Move in the xy-plane.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td class="a"><b>Scroll</b></td>
  <td>Move along the z-axis.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td class="a"><b>Meta&nbsp;Scroll</b> or<br/><b>Ctrl&nbsp;Shift&nbsp;Scroll</b></td>
  <td>Zoom in and out.</td>

<p>
Using the keyboard:
</p>
<table border="1">

</tr><tr>
  <td class="a"><b>Shift&nbsp;Y</b> or <b>Shift&nbsp;C</b></td>
  <td>Rotate to the xz-plane of the current source. (Look along the y-axis of the current source.)</td>

<h2>Annotation</h2>
<p>
Using the keyboard:
</p>
<table border="1">
<tr>
  <td class="a"><b>A</b></td>
  <td><u>Create</u> a spot at the current mouse location. The radius is taken from the last radius modification.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td class="a"><b>D</b></td>
  <td><u>Remove</u> the closest spot to the current mouse location. The mouse must be within the target spot radius.</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td class="a"><b>E</b></td>
  <td>Increase the <u>radius</u> of the spot at the current mouse location by 10%. 
  The mouse must be within the target spot radius. </br/>
  Hold <b>Shift</b> to increase it by 100%. <br/>
  Hold <b>Ctrl</b> to increase it by 1%</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td class="a"><b>Q</b></td>
  <td>Decrease the <u>radius</u> of the spot at the current mouse location by 10%. 
  The mouse must be within the target spot radius. <br/>
  Hold <b>Shift</b> to decrease it by 50%. <br/>
  Hold <b>Ctrl</b> to decrease it by 1%</td>
</tr><tr>
  <td class="a"><b>Space</b></td>
  <td>Hold space with the mouse <i>inside</i> a spot to <u>move</u> it around with the mouse. The spot
  location will follow the mouse pointer in X, Y and Z.</td>
</tr> <tr>
	<td class="a"><b>L</b></td>
	<td><u>Create/Remove a link between two spots</u>. <br>
	There must be exactly two spots in the selection, and they must not belong to the same time-point.
	If a link already exists between the two spots, pressing <b>L</b> removes it. If there is not exactly
	two spots in the selection, this does nothing.
	</td>
</tr> <tr>
	<td class="a"><b>Shift-L</b></td>
	<td>Toggle <u>auto-linking</u> mode. <br>
	If <i>on</i>, the next spot created will be automatically linked to the spot currently selected, 
	provided that the new spot is in a subsequent frame and that there is only one spot in the selection.
	The selection will then change to be the latest spot added, so that cell can be quickly followed over time
	by adding spots.</td>
</tr> <tr>
	<td class="a"><b>Shift-A</b></td>
	<td>Launch <u>semi automated tracking</u>. <br>
	Exactly one spot must be selected, with an adequate radius. It will be then automatically tracked
	in the subsequent frames, until a suitable spot can not be longer found.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Using the mouse:
</p>
<table border="1">

  <td class="a"><b>Left-double click</b> on an empty location</td>
  <td><u>Create</u> a spot at the current mouse location. The radius is taken from the last modification done.</td>

  <td class="a"><b>Left-single click</b> on a spot</td>
  <td><u>Select</u> the closest spot to the current mouse location. The mouse must be within the target spot radius. <br/>
